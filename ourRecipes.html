					<h4>How to Freeze Blueberries</h4>
					<p>It is important that the blueberries are <b>dry</b> when they are frozen. To freeze, simply place the berries in one of our BPA free freezer bags. If you are freezing berries that have been purchased from a store or from other sources that may have been sprayed, then please spray the berries with Fit chemical remover, rinse the berries repeatedly, and allow to dry. Once the berries are dry, spread as a single layer on a flat pan (such as a cookie sheet), and place in the freezer. Once the berries are frozen, please put in our BPA free freezer bags for long term storage.</p>

					<h4>Aunt Carmen's Sheet Pie</h4>
					<p><b>PIE CRUST:</b> Mix 4 cups flour, 1 tbsp sugar and 3/4 tsp salt. Cut in 2/3 c shortening-use Crisco with no trans fat-(until shortening is pea size) using a knife and fork (or pastry blender). Add 2/3 c shortening, repeat. Add 3/4 c ICE water and stir with a fork until dough sticks together well. Divide into 2 pieces and let it rest for 15 minutes. Roll out the first piece for the bottom of pan and the second for the top. Poke holes in crust and make designs with butter knife in top.<br /> <b>BLUEBERRY SHEET PIE FILLING: </b>Follow above and place bottom crust in 12 x 15 x 1/2" cookie sheet. Mix 4 cups (2 full pints) blueberries, 1 1/4 c sugar, 1/4 c tapioca, flour or cornstarch and a dash of lemon juice. Fill pan and place crust on top. Bake at 400 for 1 hour. You may use any combination of 4 c fruit. Try 1/2 pineapple or peaches or raspberries with the other half being blueberries. You may also top the cooled pie with a confectioners sugar glaze. Now Aunt Carmen is a retired wedding cake baker and a real pro. One of the things she will do that helps make her pies so tasty is up the fruit from 4 cups to 5 and she uses the tapioca.</p>

					<h4>Nancy's No Bake Blueberry Pie</h4>
					<p>This is quick, easy, delicious and great for a dish to pass--nothing will be leftover-that is for sure!  You need 2 pints of the best blueberries you can find--that would be Childs Blueberries, corn starch, cream cheese, a graham cracker crust, sugar and OJ.  Combine 1 c. blueberries and 3/4 c. water in medium sauce pan; simmer 3-4 minutes. Combine 3/4-c. sugar and 3 t. corn starch in a small bowl. Add sugar mixture to blueberries in saucepan; cook over medium heat stirring constantly until syrup is clear and thickened. Stir in 1 T. orange juice...Beat 8 oz. low fat cream cheese until fluffy then add 2 T. orange juice mixing until well blended. Spread cream cheese mixture on to the bottom of a 9" graham cracker shell; cover with 3 c. FRESH blueberries. Top with cooked blueberry mixture. Chill thoroughly and then top with whipped cream. Place a few choice berries in a smiley face on top of the whipped cream for decoration.</p>

					<h4>Dan's Organic Breakfast Smoothie Diet</h4>
					<p>To make <b>two</b> smoothies: <br />In a blender, combine 1/2 to 1 c Childs Organic Frozen Blueberries, 1/2 scoop of Warrior Blend raw plant protein (never whey protein), a dash of ground flax seed for cancer fighting, a dash of cinnamon for blood pressure, a dash of red rice yeast to lower cholesterol, a dash of ginger for weight loss, a good dash of green tea (Matcha is best) for weight loss, two tablespoons of no fat (Greek) yogurt, a 1/2 c of (almond) milk, 1/2 a frozen banana (just freeze them in a Childs BPA free freezer bag before they turn) AND 1 teaspoon of LOCAL honey for allergies and flavor. Blend and pour into a 2GO cup and out the door. If using fresh fruit, add a bit of ice. The protein will keep you full right up to lunch. If you love your pet, pour the last bit over their breakfast for added years! I estimate to have this smoothie five days a week for one year, for a couple, you will need to freeze $160 worth of blueberries, maybe a little more. Since 2010, my weight has dropped from 238 to 214 and hopefully it will be 210 by 2014. My "numbers" were elevated in 2010 but are now within acceptable parameters without statins or other medicines. This is the only significant change in diet.</p>
