					<h4>Why Organic?</h4>
					<p>We welcome you to experience superbly flavored blueberries. Our berries are grown in soil never touched by the glaciers @ 2400 feet. Blueberries grow wild on mountain tops like ours and that is one factor in why these berries taste so good and grow so well. Blueberries can be grown in the flatlands by chemically adjusting the soil but the difference is noticeable from those grown on our hill. How big is the farm? When we start weeding at the first row and go up and down each row until we reach the last bush on the last row--we have traveled more than 4 miles--about 10,000 bushes.</p>
					<p>But that is not the whole story as to why Childs Blueberries taste so much better than the "other guys" who grow their berries in the flatlands.</p>
					<p><b>Pesticide</b> includes herbicides, fungicides & insecticides. Knowledge is power--read on!</p>
					<p>Fertilizer--Rather than use petroleum based fertilizers like 10-10-10, we use OMRI approved organic manure, which is ten times more effective and healthy than petroleum based fertilizers. The Scoop--Most farms have killed the microbes in their soil with pesticides and without microbes, the plants cannot uptake nutrients from dead soil so it just runs off into the streams, rivers and lakes or pollutes the ground water (see high rates of leukemia in Midwest tied to fertilizer contamination of ground water) doing no good at all. Childs Blueberries uses organic fertilizers like kelp, emulsified trout, molasses and chicken manure that is slow release and feeds the microbes in the soil so that the bush is health and the fruit tasty and firm.</p>
					<p>Herbicide--Rather than use Monsanto's Roundup, we use OMRI approved Citrus Oil, Weed Wacker, & Hand Weeding. The Scoop--Roundup is sprayed in the soil before planting to kill weeds so that essentially you have a "brown field" prior to planting with nothing to compete for the crop the farmer wants to grow. No studies say that Roundup is bad for us in limited quantities and it has been approved by the US government for use; however, Europeans (EU) disagree with the US government and significantly restrict Roundup's use. A doctor friend of mine said this five years ago over wine on New Year's, "someday they will look back at Roundup and say it is to us what lead pipes for drinking water was to the Romans. I don't have any studies to base that on but is just what I think. We are careful to avoid it." Update--a Wall Street Journal blog out of Brussels points to a new study that finds Roundup traces in human urine. You decide but Childs Blueberries decision is not to use it.</p>
					<p>Fungicide--I have no trust for imported food products from Latin America, China, Brazil, etc. and it bothers me that frozen vegetables and fruits do not have to be labeled with "country of origin"--thanks to the big food company lobby. You could easily be eating frozen blueberries bought in a store or used in a smoothie that were grown in China. Last year, they found fungicide residual that "exceeds limits" in orange juice imported from Brazil. US farmers use this same fungicide that does not allow harvest for 42 days after application. The fungicides are absorbed by the leaves where it travels to the unripe fruit (in this case an orange) and then helps prevent mold, blisters, scabs and such as the fruit ripens.  The Scoop--Childs Blueberries uses OMRI approved Lime Sulfur during dormancy in the off season. Organic approved lime reacts with sulfur to form a caustic reaction that kills fungi.</p>
					<p>Insecticide--The Asian Fruit Fly (also know as the Spotted Wing Drosophila-SWD) is an invasive fruit fly that puts worms in soft fruits and tree fruits. It has swept across the US and this means a tremendous increase in the way insecticides are applied by farmers. Any fruits must be washed more today than yesterday. The Scoop--Childs Blueberries is isolated on the highest hill in Humphrey, NY. The hill is so high, the glaciers did not cover it and that just happens to be why blueberries grow so well on our farm. They like our type of soil. If we are invaded by this SWD pest, which we have early warning monitoring traps set for, we are ready with OMRI approved insecticides. One such organic product that works with SWD and that Japanese beetles don't like, is derived from the seed of the chrysanthemum flower, which has a naturally occurring insecticide in the shell.  It costs $525 per gallon (diluted to about $140 per acre of blueberries) and works against SWD. The downside--just as SWD has reached most farms in America, our isolation will not protect us forever. Every time I have picked up a basket of organic blueberries in the store, I have seen this worm on their blueberries inside the package. That is the problem with a conglomerate farm trying to be organic--too big to micromanage, well. Childs Blueberries may be small but we are Foremost in Quality Fruit®.</p>
					<p>Conclusion--It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat some illnesses which when compared with the cost of organically grown food makes organic seem cheap. Domestically grown organic (imported non-EU organic can be a farce) is an option you may wish to consider more often. The larger the farm--the more "space suit" type chemicals are needed. Know your farmer by frequenting local farm markets and storing up for the off season. Make food a higher priority to safeguard your own, and those you love's, personal health  You see grocery stores trying to make local a priority because they know this is important and although it is difficult for them, I admire their attempt. It should tell you how important it is to know the local, small family farmer--like Childs Blueberries.</p>
