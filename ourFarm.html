				<h2>Our Farm</h2>
				<p>Mediocre fruit will equal a mediocre result. Childs Blueberries fresh or frozen blueberries taste much better and make for a much better outcome - if you want them to "rave", you need to start with us!</p>

					<h4>Information about our farm</h4>
					<p>Our berries are grown in soil never touched by the glaciers at 2400 feet. Blueberries grow wild on mountain tops like ours and that is one factor in why these berries taste so good and grow so well. Blueberries can be grown in the flatlands by chemically adjusting the soil but the difference is noticeable from those grown on our hill. How big is the farm? When we start weeding at the first row and go up and down each row until we reach the last bush on the last row--we have traveled more than 4 miles--about 10,000 bushes.</p>
