					<h4>Our Delicious Organic Blueberries</h4>
					<p>Located in: Hinsdale, NY</p>
					<p>Note that in 2005 they were still making baby bottles out of Bisphenol A (BPA) laden plastics sold in grocery stores to unsuspecting parents - <i>despite</i> studies available to all involved in the food industry that pointed to the pending BPA conclusive studies of harm. <b>We acted for the good of our customers and upgraded our plastic bags to #4 plastic (<u>BPA free</u>) for our 36,000 run of bags,</b> despite the substantial increase in price. We spent the extra because poisoning my customers is not intelligent or ethical. Today, Reseller (Grocery) Stores are selling you canned goods lined with BPA, frozen fruits and vegetables grown overseas but not labeled as such, raspberry iced teas made and bottled in China (with whose fruit or water?) - the list goes on and on! <b>Thank <u>YOU</u> </b>for supporting your local farmers markets. If nothing else, we help keep the big chains (reasonably) honest. It makes a difference.</p>
